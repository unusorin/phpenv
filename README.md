## Hello World!

My name is phpenv. I was designed to help simplify the management of multiple
PHP installations, and was inspired by the outstanding work of both the
[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and
[ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) projects.

## How It Works

phpenv operates on the per-user directory `~/.phpenv`. Version names in
phpenv correspond to subdirectories of `~/.phpenv/versions`. For
example, you might have `~/.phpenv/versions/5.3.8` and
`~/.phpenv/versions/5.4.0`.

Each version is a working tree with its own binaries, like
`~/.phpenv/versions/5.4.0/bin/php` and
`~/.phpenv/versions/5.3.8/bin/pyrus`. phpenv makes _shim binaries_
for every such binary across all installed versions of PHP.

These shims are simple wrapper scripts that live in `~/.phpenv/shims`
and detect which PHP version you want to use. They insert the
directory for the selected version at the beginning of your `$PATH`
and then execute the corresponding binary.

Because of the simplicity of the shim approach, all you need to use
phpenv is `~/.phpenv/shims` in your `$PATH`.

## Installation
### On-line installation 

  curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unusorin/phenv/master/bin/install-debian.sh | bash

### Basic GitHub Checkout

This will get you going with the latest version of phpenv and make it
easy to fork and contribute any changes back upstream.

1. Check out phpenv into `~/.phpenv`.

        $ cd
        $ git clone git://github.com/humanshell/phpenv.git .phpenv

2. Add `~/.phpenv/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to the `phpenv`
   command-line utility.

        $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.phpenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

3. Add phpenv init to your shell to enable shims and autocompletion.

        $ echo 'eval "$(phpenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile

4. Restart your shell so the path changes take effect. You can now
   begin using phpenv.

        $ exec $SHELL

5. Rebuild the shim binaries. You should do this any time you install
   a new PHP binary.

        $ phpenv rehash

### Upgrading

If you've installed phpenv using the instructions above, you can
upgrade your installation at any time using git.

To upgrade to the latest development version of phpenv, use `git pull`:

    $ cd ~/.phpenv
    $ git pull

### Apache (httpd.conf) Setup

phpenv has been designed as a tool for a local development environment.
Currently, phpenv does not build the libphp5.so module. This is due to
permission issues during `make install` that make it difficult to compile
multiple modules and link to them for each installed PHP version dynamically.
Therefore, phpenv executes PHP as a cgi binary. To accomplish this, add the
following code to the end of your httpd.conf file:

```
# PHPENV Setup
<IfModule alias_module>
    ScriptAlias /phpenv "/PATH-TO-YOUR-HOME-FOLDER/.phpenv/shims"
    <Directory "/PATH-TO-YOUR-HOME-FOLDER/.phpenv/shims">
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</IfModule>

<IfModule mime_module>
    AddType application/x-httpd-php5 .php
</IfModule>

<IfModule dir_module>
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
</IfModule>

Action application/x-httpd-php5 "/phpenv/php-cgi"
```

**NOTE: running php as a cgi binary can be considered insecure, which you can
read about [here](http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.cgi-bin.php). PLEASE DO
NOT RUN PHPENV ON A PRODUCTION SERVER.**

### Neckbeard Configuration

Skip this section unless you must know what every line in your shell
profile is doing.

`phpenv init` is the only command that crosses the line of loading
extra commands into your shell. Here's what `phpenv init` actually does:

1. Sets up your shims path. This is the only requirement for phpenv to
   function properly. You could also do this by hand by prepending
   `~/.phpenv/shims` to your `$PATH`.

2. Installs autocompletion. This is entirely optional but pretty
   useful. Sourcing `~/.phpenv/completions/phpenv.bash` will set that
   up. There is also a `~/.phpenv/completions/phpenv.zsh` for Zsh
   users.

3. Rehashes shims. From time to time you'll need to rebuild your
   shim files. Doing this on init makes sure everything is up to
   date. You can always run `phpenv rehash` manually.

4. Installs the sh dispatcher. This bit is also optional, but allows
   phpenv and plugins to change variables in your current shell, making
   commands like `phpenv shell` possible. The sh dispatcher doesn't do
   anything crazy like override `cd` or hack your shell prompt, but if
   for some reason you need `phpenv` to be a real script rather than a
   shell function, you can safely skip it.

Run `phpenv init -` for yourself to see exactly what happens under the
hood.

## Usage

Like `git`, the `phpenv` command delegates to subcommands based on its
first argument. The most common subcommands are:

### phpenv install

The phpenv installation script is based (almost entirely) on the
[php-build](https://github.com/CHH/php-build) installation script written by
[Christoph Hochstrasser (CHH)](https://github.com/CHH). The main difference is
that it uses the [php-src](https://github.com/php/php-src) repo to compile your
individual PHP installs as opposed to downloading a tarball from php.net.

You can list the available PHP releases by running:

    $ phpenv install --releases

To build one of the listed releases run:

    $ phpenv install php-5.3.13

This command will checkout a branch to build in and install that release to
its own subdirectory in ~/.phpenv/versions/

Running `phpenv install` with no arguments will output its usage.

### phpenv global

Sets the global version of PHP to be used in all shells by writing
the version name to the `~/.phpenv/version` file. This version can be
overridden by a per-project `.phpenv-version` file, or by setting the
`PHPENV_VERSION` environment variable.

    $ phpenv global 5.4.0

The special version name `system` tells phpenv to use the system PHP
(detected by searching your `$PATH`).

When run without a version number, `phpenv global` reports the
currently configured global version.

### phpenv local

Sets a local per-project PHP version by writing the version name to
a `.phpenv-version` file in the current directory. This version
overrides the global, and can be overridden itself by setting the
`PHPENV_VERSION` environment variable or with the `phpenv shell`
command.

    $ phpenv local 5.3.8

When run without a version number, `phpenv local` reports the currently
configured local version. You can also unset the local version:

    $ phpenv local --unset

### phpenv shell

Sets a shell-specific PHP version by setting the `PHPENV_VERSION`
environment variable in your shell. This version overrides both
project-specific versions and the global version.

    $ phpenv shell 5.3.9

When run without a version number, `phpenv shell` reports the current
value of `PHPENV_VERSION`. You can also unset the shell version:

    $ phpenv shell --unset

Note that you'll need phpenv's shell integration enabled (step 3 of
the installation instructions) in order to use this command. If you
prefer not to use shell integration, you may simply set the
`PHPENV_VERSION` variable yourself:

    $ export PHPENV_VERSION=5.3.13

### phpenv versions

Lists all PHP versions known to phpenv, and shows an asterisk next to
the currently active version.

    $ phpenv versions
      5.2.8
      5.3.13
    * 5.4.0 (set by /YOUR-USERNAME/.phpenv/global)

### phpenv version

Displays the currently active PHP version, along with information on
how it was set.

    $ phpenv version
    5.4.0 (set by /YOUR-USERNAME/.phpenv/version)

### phpenv rehash

Installs shims for all PHP binaries known to phpenv (i.e.,
`~/.phpenv/versions/*/bin/*`). Run this command after you install a new
version of PHP.

    $ phpenv rehash

### phpenv which

Displays the full path to the binary that phpenv will execute when you
run the given command.

    $ phpenv which pyrus
    /YOUR-USERNAME/.phpenv/versions/5.4.0/bin/pyrus

## Development

The phpenv source code is [hosted on
GitHub](https://github.com/humanshell/phpenv). It's clean, modular,
and easy to understand (thanks to the rbenv project), even if you're not a
shell hacker.

This project is basically a clone (Read: "search and replace") of the rbenv
project. It's in need of love and support. If you're interested in improving it
please feel free to fork, submit pull requests and file bugs on the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/humanshell/phpenv/issues).
